	Note that on JBoss 6.x, the app server scanning needs to be disabled to prevent it from loading the classes before the application actually starts. 
	A quick workaround is to add to your artifact a file named WEB-INF/jboss-scanning.xml with the following content: -->
<scanning xmlns="urn:jboss:scanning:1.0">

</scanning>
